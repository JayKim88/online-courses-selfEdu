<b>Section2: Big O Notation</b>

Recap

- To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
- Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
- Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends(linear? quadratic? constant?)
- The time or space complexity(as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
- Big O Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice!

<b>Section3: Performance Evaluation of Array and Object</b>

Bio O of Object Methods

- Object.keys - O(N)
- Object.values - O(N)
- Object.entries - O(N)
- hasOwnProperty - O(1)

Big O of Arrays

- Insertion - It depends...
- Removal - It depends...
- Searching - O(N)
- Access - O(1)
