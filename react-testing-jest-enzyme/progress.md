Why to choose Enzyme

- More traditional testing style
  - Tests tightly coupled with code
  - Unit tests are very isolated
  - Tests are easy to diagnose
- Functional user flow tests(with Testing Library)
  - More resilient to refactors
  - Difficult to diagnose
- Note: code-based testing is possible with Testing Library
  - But not recommended("opinionated")
- Enzyme for projects with legacy test code

Testing Goal

- easy maintenance of tests
- easy diagnosis of failing tests
